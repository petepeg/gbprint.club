 ## A website to solve a problem that no longer exsisits
 
 I made this site for a tabletop game called Guildball. For a while new and revised cards were being released on a regular basis that needed to be printed. The problem was the company released all new and changed cards on pdf sheets with all the unchanged ones. So printing just the ones you needed was a pain. 
 
 I wrote a Python script that takes all the pdfs for the teams, and chops them up into individual cards. Than another script that can put them all back together anyway you want and export a pdf. Than I created a simple webiste with flask so you could select the cards you wanted and than generate a PDF. Shortly after I finished the game development slowed a lot, and than they just stopped. So at this point the cards are static and the website is pointless.
