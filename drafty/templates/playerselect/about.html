    <p>
        I made this site mostly for myself and my friends. I got tired of manually editing PDF's every eratta or every time a new model was released.
        I will try and keep this up to date as new cards and erratas happen, I might even do some work to make it look a little nicer.
        I am hoping it will be of some use to the community.
    </p>
    <p>
       This site was made with Flask, JS and some python scripts.
       The card images are all generated using a python script that pulls the images from the PDF's from steamforged. The cards are stored to make the page generation faster.
       The pages are made using a python script using the Pillow library.
